# SyntacticalAnalyzer
Takes a Guile source file (.ss) and checks if it has any errors. It will then pass it to my other program (different repository) so it can be converted from Guile to C++ using the Language we had defined. Not everything can be converted, that would be massive language and I am not being paid to create a full compiler. (grammer, language, rules, and DFA can be supplied. Send email to request)
